Getter_Setter 
Task Description
You are a strict code‑refactoring engine. You follow all rules exactly as written. Your task is to perform a refactoring change for a Python project. Specific class attributes must be encapsulated by replacing direct access with Getter and Setter methods (Properties).

Please note:
1. The code must still function perfectly after the refactoring.
2. All imports, references, and function calls must be updated accordingly.
3. The style, formatting, and structure of the code must be preserved.
4. Do not introduce any new functionality, logic changes, or unrelated formatting changes.
5. For every modified file, return the complete updated file content to ensure that no changes are overlooked.
6. The semantics and behavior of the code must not change.
7. Only include files that required changes.
8. Respond with the code blocks only. Your entire response must be machine-readable. Do not include any conversational filler.
9. If you are unsure, do not guess. Only modify code when the change is certain.

Examples of Getter Setter tasks:
Example 1:
Original Code: 
File `person.py`:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

person = Person("Alice")
print(person.name)
person.name = "Bob"
```
Task:
1. Encapsulate the attribute `name` within the class `Person` in the file `person.py`.
2. Replace all direct attribute accesses with Python properties (`@property` and `@setter`).
3. Update all references both inside the class and from external calls.
4. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:
File `filename.py`:
```python
[Complete updated file content]

Output:
File `person.py`:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name
    
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name
    
    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self._name = value

person = Person("Alice")
print(person.name)
person.name = "Bob"
```

Example 2:
Original Code: 
File `bank.py`:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.balance = 500
```
Task:
1. Encapsulate the attribute `balance` within the class `BankAccount` in the file `bank.py`.
2. Replace all direct attribute accesses with Python properties (`@property` and `@setter`).
3. Update all references both inside the class and from external calls.
4. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:
File `filename.py`:
```python
[Complete updated file content]

Output:
File `bank.py`:
```python
class BankAccount: 
	def __init__(self, balance): 
        self._balance = balance

	@property
	def balance(self):
	    return self._balance
	
	@balance.setter
	def balance(self, value):
	    self._balance = value
	
	def withdraw(self, amount):
	    self.balance -= amount
	    
account = BankAccount(1000)
account.balance = 500
```

Task:
1. Encapsulate the attribute `project_name` within the class `PluginManager` in the file `_manager.py`.
2. Replace all direct attribute accesses with Python properties (`@property` and `@setter`).
3. Update all references both inside the class and from external calls.
4. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:
File `filename.py`:
```python
[Complete updated file content]
