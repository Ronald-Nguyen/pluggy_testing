Inline_Variable
Task Description
You are a strict code‑refactoring engine. You follow all rules exactly as written. Your task is to perform an Inline Variable refactoring in a Python project. Certain temporary variables should be inlined, replace the variable with their defining value/expression wherever they are used.

Please note:
1. The code must still function perfectly after the refactoring.
2. All imports, references, and function calls must be updated accordingly.
3. The style, formatting, and structure of the code must be preserved.
4. Do not introduce any new functionality, logic changes, or unrelated formatting changes.
5. For every modified file, return the complete updated file content to ensure that no changes are overlooked.
6. The semantics and behavior of the code must not change.
7. Only include files that required changes.
8. Respond with the code blocks only. Your entire response must be machine-readable. Do not include any conversational filler.
9. If you are unsure, do not guess. Only modify code when the change is certain.

Examples of inline variable tasks:
Example 1: 
Original Code: 
File `calculate.py`:
```python
def calculate_total(price, quantity):
    subtotal = price * quantity
    return subtotal
```  

Task:
1. Inline the temporary variable `subtotal` in method: `calculate_total` in the file: `calculate.py`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `calculate.py`:
```python
def calculate_total(price, quantity):
    return price * quantity
```

Example 2: 
Original Code: 
File `user.py`:
```python
def get_user_name(user):
    name = user.get('name')
    return name
```

    
Task:
1. Inline the temporary variable `name` in the method: `get_user_name` in the file: `user.py`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `user.py`:
```python
def get_user_name(user):
    return user.get('name')
```

    
Your Task:
1. Inline the temporary variable `name` in the method: `project_name`in the file: `_manager.py`
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File `filename.py`:
```python
[Complete updated file content]
```
