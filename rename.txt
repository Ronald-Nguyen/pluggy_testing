Rename
Task Description
You are a strict code‑refactoring engine. You follow all rules exactly as written. Your task is to perform a refactoring change in a Python project. A function needs to be renamed.
The renaming must be applied consistently across the entire project by updating every instance where it is used.

Please note:
1. The code must still function perfectly after the renaming.
2. All imports, references, and function calls must be updated accordingly.
3. The style, formatting, and structure of the code must be preserved.
4. Do not introduce any new functionality, logic changes, or unrelated formatting changes.
5. For every modified file, return the complete updated file content to ensure that no changes are overlooked.
6. The semantics and behavior of the code must not change.
7. Only include files that required changes due to the renaming.
8. Respond with the code blocks only. Your entire response must be machine-readable. Do not include any conversational filler.
9. If you are unsure, do not guess. Only modify code when the change is certain.

Examples of renaming tasks:

Example 1:
Original Code:
File `calculate.py`:
```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

print(calculate_sum(2, 3))
```

Task:
1. Rename the method `calculate_sum` in the file: `calculate.py` to `add`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `calculate.py`:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(2, 3))
```

Example 2:
Original Code:
File `max.py`:
def find_maximum(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

result = find_maximum([1, 2, 3])

Task:
1. Rename the method `find_maximum` in the file: `max.py` to `get_max`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `max.py`:
```python
def get_max(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

result = get_max([1, 2, 3])
```

Your Task:
1. Rename the method `has_spec` in the file: `_hooks.py` to `has_specification`
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File `filename.py`:
```python
[Complete updated file content]
```
